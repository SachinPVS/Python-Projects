Customer_Churn_analysis :

As an analyst for a bank looking to grow its market share. The amount of customers using banking services has decreased recently, and the bank is concerned that some of its current customer may no longer use them as their primary bank. One of your responsibilities as a data analyst is to identify the causes of client attrition based on the data. The data scientist wants to better understand current customer behavior and maybe wants to forecast future customer attrition by feature selection and classification models, thus they are interested in your findings on the data.

Customer_information :
Stakeholders are interested in obtaining the first and last names, street address, city, state, and information on any duplicate values in the customer personal details dataset.

Credit_Card_Sales_Analysis:
 
For the year 2018 and 2019, import the credit sales data. Give the regions' minimum, maximum, average and overall sales figures.

Regression Analysis with Feature Engineering:

A high-end retailer with several location looks to find high-value customers—those who are anticipated to bring in a lot of money for the retailer—and develops a unique marketing plan just for them in order to maximize their marketing efforts. As an analyst you are using data from previous year's purchases, a predictive model may be used to forecast a customer's revenue for the upcoming year. Naturally, a customer with more projected revenue is one of higher value.
You intend to develop a model to forecast the customer's revenue in 2020 based on the purchases they made in 2019 in order to validate this strategy. The method is validated if the model operates correctly. The business can then identify high-value clients and forecast customer revenue for 2021 using the 2020 purchase data.
From the given dataset, create new variables like revenue for 2019, number of days since first and last purchase, number of purchases made by the customer, average order cost, and 2020 revenue.
